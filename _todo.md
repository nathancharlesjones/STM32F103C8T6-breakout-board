- [x] What's the pinout for the J-Link connector? -> Not compatible with 20-pin JTAG
  - [x] Is SWD reset connected to NRST or JTRST? -> NRST
    - Pin 10 on 10-pin connector (nRST) is the same as Pin 15 on 20-pin connector (RST or nSRST) and connects to NRST on STM32 (pin 7)
    - Pin 9 on 10-pin connector (NC) is the same as Pin 3 on 20-pin connector (TRST) and connects to JTRST on STM32 (PB4; pin 40)
    - Compare Figure 12 in Hardware Guide with Segger [6-pin](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/accessories/adapters/6-pin-needle-adapter/) and [10-pin adapters](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/accessories/adapters/10-pin-needle-adapter/)

- [x] Add USB connector
- [x] Finish adding power capacitors
- [x] Compare SWD connector to SOICBites/Debug Edge -> Use Debug Edge
  - Option 1: Normal 10-pin connector
    - ~$0.50/unit
    - Large footprint (200 x 500 mil)
  - Option 2: Right-angle 10-pin connector
    - ~$0.50/unit
    - Small footprint (150 x 250 mil)
    - Connector should be placed on PCB edge, with no other connectors for another 125 mil on either side
  - Option 3: SOICBites
    - $15 (one-time cost)
    - Small footprint
    - Must be placed on PCB edge; requires overhang
    - Requires hacking the SOIC connector and somehow connecting it to the J-Link
  - Option 4: Debug edge
    - ~$5 (one-time cost)
    - Large footprint (200 x 400 mil)
    - Must be placed on PCB edge; requires overhang
    - Requires building my own adapter board
    - May require building my own Eagle part (Octopart seems to be missing board outline)
    - Chamfering recommended (but possibly [not available from JLCPCB on boards <5cmx5cm](https://jlcpcb.com/quote/pcbOrderFaq/Gold%20Fingers)), though not required (according to Scott/@tannewt)
- [x] Add JLCPCB rules
- [x] Switch to 0402 resistors/capacitors
- [x] Add .gitignore
- [x] Add VUSB
  - Regulator power not needed if powering the MCU from VIN_2.0-3.6V
  - USB and VIN_5-30V need to be diode-protected, since I (may) want to have both connected at the same time. Doesn't matter which is higher, since they're both getting regulated down to 3.3V.
  - Change "VIN_2.0-3.6V" to "VDD"
  - Remove D1/D2 and install jumper; allows developer to decide whether to power the MCU from the "VDD" pin or from the regulator
  - Add "VUSB"; allows developer to power other parts of their circuit from USB.
- [x] Change 0R resistors to cut pads? -> Nah, at $0.002/resistor, it's actually easier to put down a 0R resistor than to ask someone to cut a trace
